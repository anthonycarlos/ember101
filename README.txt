This project skeleton was adapted from ember101 screencasts (http://ember101.com) by Ryan Florence.

Use this framework to get started using ember.js. Load index.html into your browser and get started.

We performed the obligatory Hello, World! exercise in just 2 lines of
code. We created the App javascript variable by calling
Ember.Application.create(); Out of the box, this creates default
infrastructure to render the handlerbars template in the view.

We then extend this example to show how binding variables to the view
template is automatic. We used the setInterval command to increment a
variable periodically. We can witness the counter incrementing in the
browser window.
